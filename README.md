Title: Employee Transport Management System Project
Pickups and drop-offs are an essential service that organizations provide transport for 
employees. If not managed well, it can be a problem rather than being a solution. The 
Employee transportation solution will provide an application platform to organize all the 
pick and drop related services.
The employee transport service application to be designed, will provide a smooth flow of 
services between the admin and the users, where the admin will be the management of 
an organization and the user will be the employees. 
• The admin panel needs to login into the application
• Admin will have many functions by which he/she can modify the pick-ups and drop-
offs related services.
These functions include:
• Add driver where he can add the driver,
• Add vehicle where he can add vehicles to the employees, 
• Admin can view bookings and manage time slot.
On the other end, the employee’s first needs to register into the system by filling up basic 
registration details.
• After successful registration
• Employee can login by using their login credentials.
• Once the user logs in into the system, he/she can view available time slots
• Employee can select a time slot according to their shift timings.
All these features will provide a hassle-free pick and drop management system an 
organization.  
You are required to build the front-end of the Employee Transport Management System
using the following web development technologies:
• Hypertext Markup Language (HTML 5)
• Cascading Style Sheet (CSS)
• Javascript
• Bootstrap
